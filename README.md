This repo is a React.JS-powered front-end for a simple CRUD library application. 
## 
In order to run this application, please download the goals-api repo found on this GitHub account. 
When you first start the application,  you'll be able to navigate between pages, but there will be no content.
To add content, first ensure that your API is runinng, then click on the Login tab of the navbar. This will take you to the login page, from which you can register an account. Once in the register modal, select the checkbox that indicates that the registering user is an admin. This will allow you to create, edit and delete books in the library. Keep in mind that created accounts are stored in Auth0. You will need to login in order to create, rent,  edit or delete any books. Once rented, you can navigate to the user profile page to view your active rentals.
